<h2>Dataset Bias Team</h2><h3>Ashley Kim</h3><p>We try to solve the following questions: <ol><li>Does the concentration of the objects of interest in the training data of a model change how well that model will transfer to a new data set with objects of interest concentrated in a different region?</li><li>And if so, does augmenting the data to reduce distinctiveness decrease the amount of labels required?</li><li>And if so, what is the number of augmented data and label required while not giving up accuracy.</li></ol>We are in the process of validating how dataset's distinctiveness impacts a model's accuracy meaning validating biases within the datasets.</p>
