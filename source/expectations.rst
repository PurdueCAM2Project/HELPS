CAM2 Progress Evaluation Expectations
========================================

Version: |today|

**Note**: Requirements and dates are not final and subject to change. 

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each semester students who participate in CAM2 research are expected to fulfill the requirements outlined in this document. These requirements you will be given an opportunity to **prove** you deserve a good grade in the class. The focus of the class is **not** effort but contribution to the project and ability to communicate that contribution to your teammates and advisors. Your contribution is the work you have done during the semester and the progress you made. 

Contribution to the project will be evaluated by completion of the following requirements:

#) `Research Notebook`_
#) `Presentations`_
#) `Final Report`_

These requirements will be outlined in more detail below.

Research Notebook
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each student is required to keep a notebook of their activity on the project throughout the semester. Good researchers keep detailed notes so their work can be replicated easily. Keeping good notes is also a primary method used for you to prove your contribution to the project. 

**Q:** *What should I put in my notes?*
########################################

Notes must be **detailed** and **understandable** not only to you but also **to other teammates**. Students should keep notes during team meetings and during individual work. Every time work is done on the project, notes should be updated. 

The contents of your notes should include (but is not limited to): 

 - What problem are you trying to solve?
 - Why is this problem important for the project?
 - What are some solutions your team brainstormed? 
 - What did you do to help solve this problem?
 - Why did you think this would work as a solution?
 - Did it work how you anticipated? Why? 
 - What did you learn? 

**Q:** *How should I share my notes with my teammates?*
########################################################

The notes you create must be shared on your team Confluence page. Each student should create their own confluence page under their CAM2 team page. 


Setting up you Confluence Page
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++




**Q:** *How will my notes be evaluated?*
########################################################

The notes will be graded at least 5 times throughout the semester at random intervals. In order to ensure you receive full credit for your notes you should update them regularly. Notes will be graded based on the following properties:

#) **Level of Detail** - Your notes should be sufficiently detailed with figures and relevant descriptions. Your contribution to the project should be clear from your notes. 
#) **Reproducibility** - Can your progress be reproduced by your teammates only from your notes? Do you link to other resources you used? 
#) **Regularly Updated** - Are the notes current to your team's progress? Do you have notes for all team meetings?


Presentations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each student is expected to give three presentations throughout the semester. The goal of these presentations is to assess your ability to verbally share your research. This is an important skill for researchers as they are often asked to share their research at conferences. The first two presentations will give you an opportunity to practice for the final presentation. 

Each presentation gives you the opportunity to showcase what contributions you have made. You are expected to give **detailed and informative** presentations that meet the minimum time requirements. It is acceptable to include questions or discussion at the end of your presentation as long as you have given detailed content that meets the minimum time requirements. 

**You must practice each presentation.** Do not imagine that you can give a good presentation without practice. It is not possible. It will be obvious if you do not practice. A bad presentation will negatively impact your grade.

**In addition to the content of the first two presentations, answer some of the following questions:**

 - What has changed about your understanding of the problem?
 - Do your contributions correctly address the problem you proposed? (It's okay if they don't say why!)
 - Do you need to modify your proposed problem or solution to better align with the needs of the project?
 - Do your notes and report successfully communicate your contribution?
 - Have you discovered anything that would change the viability of your solution?
 - How can you improve your documentation and ensure that others can continue your work?
 - Do you understand your contribution and the project well enough to communicate it to others?
 - Is your work well organized so that anyone can understand it?
 - Can you answer detailed questions about the material you are working with?


The Importance of Peer Feedback

Final Report
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another important way researchers share their work is through writing research "white papers". You will undoubtedly be asked to read research papers related to your work throughout the semester. Publications are significant in the research community because it allows other researchers to review and validate the work of the community. Research papers are the primary "products" of a research team and help build the credibility of a research organization within a community. Becoming a researcher means you will have to create these research reports and review reports created by other groups. You can view publications created by members of the CAM2 project `here <https://purduehelps.org/product.html#publications>`_.

During the course of the semester, each CAM2 *team* is expected to create a publication that will be reviewed by your peers. In many cases, teams go on to publish these reports in academic journals or at conferences. This is a great opportunity for you to get experience communicating your work to the world and help build your resume. 

Basic Report Requirements
##########################

#) Each team **must** use `LaTeX <https://www.latex-project.org/>`_ to write your report. All CAM2 teams write research papers using LaTeX so it is important that you learn. **Note**: For most draft submissions you must use `Overleaf <https://www.overleaf.com>`_ (free for Purdue students) instead of installing LaTeX manually. Overleaf also makes it easier to share your progress with your teammates.
#) Each report should follow `Professor Lu's IEEE Conferences Paper Template <https://www.overleaf.com/read/hrwwypkdjkwq>`_. Exceptions will be made if your team is planning to submit to a conference that requires a different template. 
#) Each report must be between 6-8 pages. Exceptions may be made if your team is planning to submit to a conference that has different length requirements. Please ask if this is the case. 

Report Draft Submissions
#########################

Your team will submit several drafts of the report throughout the semester to give others the opportunity to evaluate and critique your work. We expect your team to continually revise the content and organization of the report as the semester goes on. This means that although you may only be submitting the "Related Work" section of the paper you may need to revise your "Abstract" to match the "Related Work" section. 

**Note**: Each draft of the report should be submitted as a group assignment on BlackBoard **as a PDF file** and a link must be shared to the Overleaf.

Abstract Draft
+++++++++++++++

The Abstract Draft should include the paper title and abstract section. 

For the abstract section can be laid out as follows:

 - Problem (2-3 sentences)
 - Existing work and deficiencies (2-3 sentences)
 - Your method and why it is better (3 sentences)
 - Evaluation methods (2-4 sentence)
 - Results and comparison (3 sentences)


Related Work Draft
++++++++++++++++++

Related work section helps give context and creditability to the work you have done. It shows that your team has reviewed the state of the art work in this area and improved on it. In many cases you will introduce metrics that can be used to judge how your work improves on the previous state of the art. 

Related articles can be searched for using `Google Scholar <https://scholar.google.com>`_ or on `Purdue Libraries <https://www.lib.purdue.edu/>`_. Many times articles can be found in the `IEEE Xplore Digital Library <https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ezproxy.lib.purdue.edu/Xplore/home.jsp>`_ and the `ACM Digital Library <https://dl-acm-org.ezproxy.lib.purdue.edu/dl.cfm>`_

Do not imagine that your work is so special and there is no related work
It is not possible that you are the very first person in human history solving this problem
Some people must have investigate similar, possibly exactly the same, problems
If you do not find anything similar, you have not worked hard enough finding related work

The final number of references is approximately 2 to 2.5 x the number of pages.
