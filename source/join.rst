Join the Research Team
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dr. Lu (almost every professor) receives too many meaningless messages
from careless students. In most cases, the students do not even know
where the messages are sent to. Many messages ask to join Dr. Lu's
research team even though Dr. Lu has never done anything on the topics
of the senders' interest. Dr. Lu will not respond to these
messages. Dr. Lu will respond to only questions from students that are
already at Purdue or have already received admissions from Purdue. If
you are not at Purdue, please contact the admission office. Dr. Lu
will not answer questions like "Can I get an admission to Purdue?" or
"Can you give me funding?"

Before you contact Dr. Lu, ask yourself these questions:

- Do I know what this research team is doing?
  
- Have I read this team's recent papers and understood?
  
- Do I want to conduct research on these topics?
  
- Can I contribute to solving the research problems?
  
- Do not send email to Dr. Lu if you have no answer. Don't waste your time. 

Should you do research? Research, like any other activities that
require long-term efforts (such as marathon, chess, painting...), is
not for everyone. "Everyone should do research." is as valid as
"Everyone should run marathon." or "Everyone should play chess."
Before you join a research team (any team), think about the
reasons. What do you want to accomplish? Why do you want to do
research with this team? Remember, time is your most precious
asset. Do you want to spend your time with these people? Why? Do these
people want to spend time with you? Why?

If you want to talk to Dr. Lu, his office is MSEE 222.

The team's mission is to create leaders. The research projects' mission is to create the technologies saving lives.

For undergraduate students: This research team gives undergraduate
students the true experience of research. You will be given research
problems, not classroom homework assignments. You need to solve these
research problems and have contributions to the research community
(such as research papers, open-source software, data). This is a large
research team in the number of undergraduate students on Purdue
campus. You will get the opportunities learning from other students,
making life-long friends, solving problems that are too difficult for
small teams.

For graduate students: This team has many undergraduate students and
you can get rare experience working with these students solving large
research problems. They may help you review literature or conduct
experiments. They may critique your methods. You may get the
opportunity leading a team.

It is expected that you are comfortable writing computer programs. You
should have the skills equivalent to ECE 264 (or CS 240) at Purdue. CS
159 is insufficient. You must be able to learn Python.

Research requires a lot of self learning. If you learn in classroom
only and need step-by-step guidance by teaching assistants, you are
not ready for research.

This research provides unique experience that is uncommon on campus:
all students (including undergraduate students) solve research
problems. Since research problems are difficult, this team has the
following requirements:

- Every student is expected to stay for at least two semesters (summer
  counts as a semester). Many students stay in the team for 2 years or
  even longer. Why? They want to solve research problems. If you
  intend to stay for only semester, do not come.  One semester is too
  short to accomplish anything meaningful.
  
- Every new member must pass an interview with current members.
  
- Every new member will receive fast-pace training. This takes the
  efforts of current members.
  
- During spring or fall semester, every new member must take a
  research course (ECE 279, 379, 479, CS 490, or similar). The reason
  is simple: without taking a research course, new members always
  vanish when their coursework becomes heavy. This wastes everyone's
  time.

- Teamwork is absolutely critical. If you want to work alone, do not
  come.

- Every member must make a commitment to solving research
  problems. This team demands serious efforts. This is a research team
  and entertainment is not the purpose.

- Learning is an essential part of doing research but research is much
  more than learning. Research must create new things (new software,
  new data, new theory, new algorithms, new interpretation...). If you
  do not create anything new, you are not doing research. "New" means
  new to human knowledge, not new to you. If your only intention is to
  "learn" without solving research problems, do not come. If you want
  to learn, take classes or read books (or papers).

- Members are expected to interact in both professional and social
  settings. Many solutions are discovered when people talk outside
  research laboratories. Communication with your team is an essential
  part of research. The social events are important parts of member
  interactions. If you do not want to participate in any social event,
  do not join this research team.

- This is a research team. It is not an amusement park. This team
  solves research problems and does not host tourists. Join this team
  only if you want to solve research problems. Spend at least six
  hours per week on the research project and attend weekly team
  meetings.

- Report progress in writing and speaking.  Research, by definition,
  is to discover new things. Thus, you must explain what you have
  discovered by speaking and writing.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------
  
- Q: It seems that you are discouraging people to join your team, why?
  Will anyone actually want to join?

- A: Too many people treat "research" as visiting an amusement
  park. They are looking for "fun" without the intention of taking
  efforts. They show up when they want to; they may leave at any
  moment. They expect to get A easily. This research team does not
  need those people. This research team welcomes only the people that
  are serious about solving research problems. Many people want to
  join this team because these people know everyone in this team is
  serious about solving research problems.

- Q: How many hours do I need to spend per week?

- A: **What do you want to accomplish?** You need to spend at least
  six hours a week. If you cannot, you are wasting your time because
  you can accomplish nothing.  Many people spend more than six hours a
  week. If you are leading a research paper, it is possible that you
  spend 30 hours (or more) the week before submission.


- Q: If I am selected, I will stay for at least two semesters, right?

- A: Not necessarily. The team may be reorganized. A particular topic
  may be eliminated if enough progress has been made. A member may be
  released (not "fired") if the member shows no progress.

- Q: Your team demands a lot. What do members get?

- A: Why do people climb high mountains? Why do people compete in
  World Cup? They want to accomplish something extraordinary.  This
  team gives members the pride of solving research problems,
  friendship with excellent researchers, authorship (or co-authorship)
  of research papers, strong recommendation letters, excellent job
  offers, and occasionally, pizza.

- Q: I do not want to take a research course because I already have
  too many credits.

- A: If you have too many credits, you will not have time doing
  research. You will definitely vanish when your coursework becomes
  heavy. Do not come.

- Q: This is my last semester and I do not want to take too many credits.

- A: If this is your last semester, you will not stay for two
  semester. Do not come.

- Q: I guarantee that I will stay, even though I do not take a research course.

- A: You will not stay. You know very clearly. You do not want to take
  a research course because you cannot spend time. Do not come. Many
  people "assured" that they would stay without taking credits.
  Everyone vanished. In fact, these people simply vanished without
  saying "Good Bye". This team does not need these people.

- Q: If you are so restrictive, how many people actually apply for joining the team?

- A: For Spring 2019, about 120 people wanted to join or stay in this
  team. This team's size has been growing rapidly in recent
  semesters. Many people want to join this team because they want to
  spend time with those that are serious about solving research
  problems.

- Q: Do you set a limit on the team's size?

- A: We welcome everyone that wants to solve research problems.  

  

About Financial Support
=======================

Most students do not know how universities operate in terms of
finance. As a result, they think professors magically have unlimited
funds to support as many students as the professors decide. Before you
ask Dr. Lu to provide financial support, please be aware of the
following facts:

- Dr. Lu does not print money. Research fund does not fall from sky like rain drops.
  
- Purdue University does not give students' tuition to professors for
  doing research. The tuition goes to facilities such as networks,
  buildings, furniture, electricity, staff, administration, cleaning
  ...
  
- For every $100 Dr. Lu spends on research (including machines, travel
  to conferences, salary for students ...), Purdue takes $55 for
  facilities such as networks, buildings, furniture, electricity,
  cleaning ... Thus, Dr. Lu has to request $155 from project sponsors.
  
- Purdue does not give research money to professors because the
  professors have a lot of students.
  
- Dr. Lu works with many students because he wants to give more
  students research experience. He enjoys the intellectual
  interactions with many excellent students. He also thinks the
  interactions among students help them succeed. The size of his
  research team has no effect on how much Purdue gives for research
  (always $0).
  
- Dr. Lu has zero influence about how Purdue spends tuition. Please
  talk to Purdue President if you have any suggestions.
  
- Dr. Lu has zero influence on other professors' decisions. Dr. Lu
  cannot tell any other professor to provide any student financial
  support.
  
- Dr. Lu obtains research funding by writing proposals.
  
- Financial supports are divided into three types: fellowship,
  teaching assistantship, and research assistantship. Dr. Lu has no
  control of fellowship or teaching assistantship.
  
- Research assistantship is a type of employment: a research assistant
  is an employee of Purdue University for conducting research
  described in the corresponding research proposal.  If you do not do
  what is written in the proposal, you cannot receive research
  assistantship.

- Professors provide research assistantship because the work in the
  proposals have to be carried out, not because professors are "nice".

Common Mistakes by Students
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Some students think "doing research" means disappearing for five
  years and coming back with world-changing discovery or invention.
  It does not work that way. You need to regularly (about once a week)
  report progress.
  
- Financial support is free money and students have complete freedom doing whatever they want.  
  
- Some students go to professors and say, "Give me money." They do not
  know that, in a bank office, this is called robbery and is a crime.
  
- Some students think sending emails to professors and money will be
  transferred to the students' bank accounts the next day.

How to Get Financial Support from Dr. Lu?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Understand that Dr. Lu has no obligation giving you financial support. You have to earn it.
  
- Getting financial support from Dr. Lu will take you a lot of efforts.
  
- Read at least five of his papers published in the last three
  years. Do not initiate any conversation before you finish reading
  the papers.
  
- Prepare to have multiple, long, and deep technical discussions.
  
- Dr. Lu has a large established research program. You must do what
  the research program needs.
  
- Dr. Lu can support only Purdue students.
  
- Dr. Lu emphasizes teamwork greatly. You have to work with a
  team. You must have good communication skills.
