-------------

We use crowdsourcing to utilizes the knowledge of humans to complete a task.
In the scope of research, we are using the crowd to handle specific
asks that may be hard for a machine to do or improve the work of a machine.
This may include tasks such as detecting bias within image datasets
using human knowledge rather than machines, since humans are better
at distinguishing features within images. This semester, we are utilizing
crowdsourcing to help select the most suitable machine model to use for
unsupervised domain adaptation. We use the crowd to classify images to
datasets and generate a confusion matrix detailing the similarity of
images across several datasets.
