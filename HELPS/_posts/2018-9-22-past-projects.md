#### **Autonomous Information Dissemination in Randomly Deployed Sensor Networks (2007-2012)**
##### Primary researcher: [Jing (Jackie) Feng](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ResearchGroups/HELPS/index.html#Jackie)

##### A wireless sensor network (WSN) is a wireless network consisting of spatially distributed autonomous devices using sensors to cooperatively monitor physical or environmental conditions, such as temperature, sound, vibration, pressure, motion or pollutants, at different locations. When sensors are far from the receiver, individual sensor or hop-by-hop transmission doesn't have enough energy. This project is to create a new sensor network architecture, AIDA, that uses antenna arrays of the distributed sensor nodes to create directional radio waves which can give stronger signals than individual antenna of the sensor nodes. Because of wave reinforcement and cancellation, the signals need to be highly directional and in phase at the receiver point.

#### **Energy Conservation for Multimedia Systems on Mobile Devices** 
##### Primary researcher: [Jing (Jackie) Feng](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ResearchGroups/HELPS/index.html#Jackie)
##### Multimedia content such as image and video usually require memory- and computation-intensive processing and thus cost a large amount of energy. In this project, we devise energy-efficient implementations of several multimedia applications on mobile device. We also explore the server-client communication and computation cost to make offloading decisions. The ultimate goal is to develop a general and efficient framework for multimedia applications on mobile devices.
