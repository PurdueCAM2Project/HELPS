<p>“This is where my skills andknowlege are put into use. You get to understand what you have learnt and why you learnt them. I feel great when I’m actually contributing.” - Yezhi Shen, CAM2 member</p>

<p>Before you contact Dr. Lu, ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Do I know what this research team is doing?</p></li>
<li><p>Have I read this team’s recent papers?</p></li>
<li><p>Do I want to conduct research on these topics?</p></li>
<li><p>Can I contribute to solving the research problems?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Do not send email to Dr. Lu if you have no answer.
.. Don’t waste your time.</p>
<p>Should you do research? Research, like any other activities that
require long-term efforts (such as marathon, chess, painting…), is
not for everyone. “Everyone should do research.” is as valid as
“Everyone should run marathon.” or “Everyone should play chess.”
Before you join a research team, think about the reasons. What do you
want to accomplish? Why do you want to do research with this team?
Remember, time is your most precious asset. Do you want to spend your
time with these people? Why? Do these people want to spend time with
you? Why?</p>
<p>If you want to talk to Dr. Lu, his office is MSEE 222.</p>
<p>This research team gives students (including undergraduate students)
the true experience of research. You will be given research problems,
not classroom homework assignments. You need to solve these research
problems and have contributions to the research community (such as
research papers, open-source software, data). This is a large research
team in the number of students. You will get the opportunity
to learn from other students, making life-long friends, solving
problems that are too difficult for small teams.
For graduate students: This team has many undergraduate students and
you can get rare experience working with these students solving large
research problems. They may help you review literature or conduct
experiments. They may critique your methods. You may get the
opportunity leading a team.
It is expected that you are comfortable writing computer programs. You
should have the skills equivalent to ECE 264 (or CS 240) at Purdue. CS
159 is insufficient. You must be able to learn Python.</p>
<p>Research requires a lot of self learning. If you learn in classroom
only and need step-by-step guidance by teaching assistants, you are
not ready for research.</p>
<p>This research team provides unique experience that is uncommon on campus:
all students (including undergraduate students) solve research
problems. Since research problems are difficult, this team has the
following requirements:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Every student is expected to stay for at least two semesters (summer
counts as a semester). Many students stay in the team for 2 years or
even longer. Why? They want to solve research problems. If you
intend to stay for only semester, do not come.  One semester is too
short to accomplish anything meaningful.  Do not waste your time.</p></li>
<li><p>Every new member will receive fast-pace training. This takes the
efforts of current members.</p></li>
<li><p>During spring or fall semester, every new member must take a
research course (ECE 279, 379, 479, CS 490, or similar). The reason
is simple: without taking a research course, new members always
vanish when their coursework becomes heavy.</p></li>
<li><p>Teamwork is absolutely critical.  If you want to work alone, do not
come.</p></li>
<li><p>Every member must make a commitment to solving research
problems. This team demands serious efforts.</p></li>
<li><p>Research must create new things (new software, new data, new theory,
new algorithms, new interpretation…). If you do not create
anything new, you are not doing research. “New” means new to human
knowledge, not new to you. If your only intention is to “learn”
without solving research problems, do not come.</p></li>
<li><p>Members are expected to interact in both professional and social
settings. Many solutions are discovered when people talk outside
research laboratories. Communication with your team is an essential
part of research. The social events are important parts of member
interactions. If you do not want to participate in any social event,
do not join this research team.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Report progress in writing and speaking.  Research, by definition,
is to discover new things. Thus, you must explain what you have
discovered by speaking and writing.</p></li>
<li><p>This research team does not accept students that come with their own
agenda. This team solves research problems that take long time. The
topics have been determined long before any new member joins the
team.  As a new member, you are not allowed to suggest new
topics. The team does not care what you want to do. As a new member,
you must solve the problems that have already been selected by the
team.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions<a class="headerlink" href="#frequently-asked-questions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Q: It seems that you are discouraging people to join your team, why?
Will anyone actually want to join?</p></li>
<li><p>A: Too many people treat “research” as visiting an amusement
park. They are looking for “fun” without the intention of taking
efforts. They show up when they want to; they leave at any
moment. They expect to get A easily. This research team does not
need those people. This research team welcomes only the people that
are serious about solving research problems. Yes, this team has many
students because these people are serious about solving research
problems.</p></li>
<li><p>Q: How many hours do I need to spend per week?</p></li>
<li><p>A: <strong>What do you want to accomplish?</strong> You need to spend at least
six hours a week. If you cannot, you are wasting your time because
you can accomplish nothing.  Many people spend much more than six
hours a week. If you are leading a research paper, it is possible
that you spend 30 hours (or more) per week for several weeks before
submission.</p></li>
<li><p>Q: Your team demands a lot. What do members get?</p></li>
<li><p>A: Why do people climb high mountains? Why do people compete in
World Cup? They want to accomplish something extraordinary.  This
team gives members friendship with excellent researchers, authorship
of research papers, strong recommendation letters, excellent job
offers, and occasionally, pizza. Above everything else, <strong>this team
gives members the pride of solving research problems</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Q: I do not want to take a research course because I already have
too many credits.</p></li>
<li><p>A: If you have too many credits, you will not have time doing
research. You will definitely vanish when your coursework becomes
heavy. Do not come.</p></li>
<li><p>Q: This is my last semester and I do not want to take too many credits.</p></li>
<li><p>A: If this is your last semester, you will not stay for two
semester. Do not come.</p></li>
<li><p>Q: I guarantee that I will stay, even though I do not take a research course.</p></li>
<li><p>A: You will not stay. You know very clearly. You do not want to take
a research course because you cannot spend time. Do not come. Many
people “assured” that they would stay without taking credits.
Everyone vanished.  This team does not need these people.</p></li>
<li><p>Q: If you are so restrictive, how many people actually apply for joining the team?</p></li>
<li><p>A: For Spring 2019, about 120 people wanted to join or stay in this
team. This team’s size has been growing rapidly in recent
semesters. Many people want to join this team because they want to
spend time with those that are serious about solving research
problems.</p></li>
<li><p>Q: Do you set a limit on the team’s size?</p></li>
<li><p>A: We welcome everyone that wants to solve research problems.</p></li>
<li><p>Q: I have an idea. Can you help me?</p></li>
<li><p>A: No. Go away. This team selects research problems that take many
years to solve. The team will not change research topics because of
your idea.</p></li>

<h2>About Financial Support<a class="headerlink" href="#about-financial-support" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Most students do not know how universities operate in terms of
finance. As a result, they think professors magically have unlimited
funds to support as many students as the professors decide. Before you
ask Dr. Lu to provide financial support, please be aware of the
following facts:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Dr. Lu does not print money. Research fund does not fall from sky like rain drops.</p></li>
<li><p>Purdue University does not give students’ tuition to professors for
doing research. The tuition goes to facilities such as networks,
buildings, furniture, electricity, staff, administration, cleaning
…</p></li>
<li><p>For every $100 Dr. Lu spends on research (including machines, travel
to conferences, salary for students …), Purdue takes $55 for
facilities such as networks, buildings, furniture, electricity,
cleaning … Thus, Dr. Lu has to request $155 from project sponsors.</p></li>
<li><p>Purdue does not give research money to professors because the
professors have a lot of students.</p></li>
<li><p>Dr. Lu works with many students because he wants to give more
students research experience. He enjoys the intellectual
interactions with many excellent students. He also thinks the
interactions among students help them succeed. The size of his
research team has no effect on how much Purdue gives him for
research (always $0).</p></li>
<li><p>Dr. Lu has zero influence about how Purdue spends tuition. Please
talk to Purdue President if you have any suggestions.</p></li>
<li><p>Dr. Lu has zero influence on other professors’ decisions. Dr. Lu
cannot tell any other professor to give any student financial
support.</p></li>
<li><p>Dr. Lu obtains research funding by writing proposals.</p></li>
<li><p>Financial supports are divided into three types: fellowship,
teaching assistantship, and research assistantship. Dr. Lu has no
control of fellowship or teaching assistantship.</p></li>
<li><p>Research assistantship is a type of employment: a research assistant
is an employee of Purdue University for conducting research
described in the corresponding research proposal.  If you do not do
what is written in the proposal, you cannot receive research
assistantship.</p></li>
<li><p>Professors provide research assistantship because the work in the
proposals have to be carried out, not because professors are “nice”.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="common-mistakes-by-students">
<h3>Common Mistakes by Students<a class="headerlink" href="#common-mistakes-by-students" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Some students think “doing research” means disappearing for five
years and coming back with world-changing discovery or invention.</p></li>
<li><p>Financial support is free money and students have complete freedom doing whatever they want.</p></li>
<li><p>Some students go to professors and say, “Give me money.” They do not
know that, in a bank office, this is called robbery and is a crime.</p></li>
<li><p>Some students think sending emails to professors and money will be
transferred to the students’ bank accounts the next day.</p></li>

<h3>How to Get Financial Support from Dr. Lu?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-get-financial-support-from-dr-lu" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Understand that Dr. Lu has no obligation to give you financial support. You have to earn it.</p></li>
<li><p>Getting financial support from Dr. Lu will take you a lot of
efforts. He will not give you money because you send an email.</p></li>
<li><p>Read at least five of his papers published in the last three
years. Do not initiate any conversation before you finish reading
the papers.</p></li>
<li><p>Prepare to have multiple, long, and deep technical discussions.</p></li>
<li><p>Dr. Lu has a large established research program. You must do what
the research program needs. He does not care about your new ideas.</p></li>
<li><p>Dr. Lu can support only Purdue students.</p></li>
<li><p>Dr. Lu emphasizes teamwork greatly. You have to work with a
team. You must have good communication skills.</p></li>

<h2>Research is NOT Classroom Learning<a class="headerlink" href="#research-is-not-classroom-learning" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A research group is fundamentally different from a classroom. A
classroom is usually an inclusive environment: most instructors allow
auditors. In contrast, a research team is a “privileged” environment
and only selected members can participate.  Many reasons make research
team restrictive, for example,</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The members in the team use the facilities that are purchased
using research fund.</p></li>
<li><p>The members must have ability to understand and improve
state-of-the-art solutions.</p></li>
<li><p>The members are inventing a new solution that may lead to a
patent. Before this patent is filed and granted, the members must
protect the intellectual properties.</p></li>
<li><p>The members are writing a research paper and everyone must be
qualified to contribute to the content.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you like sports, you need to ask yourself a simple question: “Am I
ready to join a professional team?” This research team is professional
because the team solves research problems that have not been solved by
anyone yet. If you are not ready to contribute, you will not enjoy the
experience and current team members cannot work with you.</p>
<p>This is a research team. You come to solve research problem. You do
not come to learn. If you want to learn, go to take courses or read
books. This team does not accept anyone that wants to join and learn,
without contributions to solving research problems. This team accepts
only the people that wants to solve research problems. Please <strong>evaluate
whether you are ready to contribute.</strong></p>
<div class="section" id="differences-between-students-and-researchers">
<h3>Differences between Students and Researchers<a class="headerlink" href="#differences-between-students-and-researchers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Before joining this team, please make sure you understand the differences
between students and researchers.  A student with high GPA is not
necessarily a good researcher. Some excellent researchers do not have
high GPA.  Why? Because taking classes and doing research are very
very different.</p>
<p>How does a student get a good grade? Usually, by submitting
assignments and answering exam questions. Due to the semester (or
quarter) structure, a course can last only 15 (or 10) weeks. As a
result, every assignment has to be finished within several
weeks. Also, most exam questions are limited to well-defined problems
that can be answered within one or two hours.  This structure has
tremendous impacts on how students think.  Many students (mistakenly)
think everything can be done within a few weeks because students never
have experience doing anything longer than a few weeks. Most students
cannot comprehend the complexity of any problem that takes more than
several weeks.</p>
<p>Research is almost the opposite of everything in
classroom. The following table summarizes the main differences between
“student thinking” and “researcher thinking”:</p>
