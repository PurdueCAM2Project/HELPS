title: Improving the Consistency of Object Detection

<h2>Improving the Consistency of Object Detection</h2>
The Adaptive Object Detection team is focused on improving the consistency and stability of object detection. Our team has filmed six, thirty-second video snippets across Purdue's campus. This data is necessary to observe when YOLOv3's detection results are unstable. YOLOv3 is a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm. We collected data under a variety of settings, indoors and outside. We have observed that YOLOv3 is generally more unstable when the camcorder that filmed the video was nonstationary in contrast to filming from a stationary tripod. Furthermore, we have observed inconsistent detections when the image has many objects or when some objects are moving quickly across the scene. Future work will include quantifiably characterizing how unstable YOLOv3's detections are and looking at the intermediary layers of YOLOv3 to gain a better understanding of why it is detecting inconsistently.
