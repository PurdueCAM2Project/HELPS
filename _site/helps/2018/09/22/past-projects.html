When sensors are far from the receiver, individual sensor or hop-by-hop transmission doesnâ€™t have enough energy. This project is to create a new sensor network architecture, AIDA, that uses antenna arrays of the distributed sensor nodes to create directional radio waves which can give stronger signals than individual antenna of the sensor nodes. Because of wave reinforcement and cancellation, the signals need to be highly directional and in phase at the receiver point.</h5>

In this project, we devise energy-efficient implementations of several multimedia applications on mobile device. We also explore the server-client communication and computation cost to make offloading decisions. The ultimate goal is to develop a general and efficient framework for multimedia applications on mobile devices.</h5>
